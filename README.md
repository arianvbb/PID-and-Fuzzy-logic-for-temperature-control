# ☑️Temperature-control-using-Fuzzy-logic
This set of scripts uses Fuzzy logic to maintain a temperature in an environment. Plans to add PID and MPC in the future.

## ❇️Features
- **Input**: Inputs that gathers all the information needed to run the simulation.
- **Monte-Carlo Simulation**: The simulation itself is the most important feature in this code and is what runs the simulation and assures accurate results.
- **Graph**: Matplotlib is used to graph where all the simulations end up making it easy to see where the vast majority have end up, being your result.

#### This project was made entirely in Python using numpy, matplotlib and local libraries.

## 🤔The Process 

I started watching the official video from MIT on Monte-Carlo simulation to get an idea of how it works. From there I decided on this project.

I tried a lot on my own and eventually got it working, althought figuring out how to plot all simulations took a while of reading documentation to figure out.

The project included a lot of trial and error and is one of the more fun but hard projects I had done to date.

## 📚My takeaways 

My main takeaway from this is the theory behind Monte-Carlo simulation and how it works. Truly something I'll have a ton of use for in future projects.

I also learnt that maths can be very difficult to code into Python, integrals for example aren't quite as easy to plot in code as they are in real life.

Lastly I got to enhance my plotting skills in matplotlib even fruther.

## 🚀Running the project 

1. Copy the program to your computer.
2. Using an editor and Python installed you can simply run the program and it should run fine.
3. Make sure to input numbers, the code is run inside the editor.
